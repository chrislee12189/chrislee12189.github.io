                <li>Scary Movies!</li>
                <li>Video Games -particularly fantasy RPGs and the ocassional FPS</li>
                <li>Reading Books -particularly fantasy books</li>
                <li>Documentaries -particularly animal docos, murder docos and anything related to nuclear disaster</li>
                <li>Art -particularly dark, gothic and even religious themed art</li>
                <li>Music -particularly heavy metal style music, though i open to anything catchy enough</li>

    <h1>How do i currently partake in my hobbies?</h1>
    <section>
        <ol style="font-style:oblique">
            <li>Literally any tv anywhere is how i usually get inovled with this.</li>
            <li>I built a custom gaming pc. It is directly responsible for my decline in socialising over the past few years.</li>
            <li>Reading books is an easy hobby, you just need a book. Its pretty simple from that point onwards.</li>
            <li>Watching documentaries makes for interesting dinner times, though im at the mercy of netflix when it comes to choices.</li>
                <li>Getting involved with art was easy enough, my partner is a tattoist and so im able to meet some incredible artists from all around the world.</li>
            <li>My music taste is something that developed all the way back in highschool. Seems forever ago, is it too early for a mid-life crisis?</li>
            <li>Im currently involved with coding through Coder Academy!</li>
